# XPENS

Xpens is a [web application](https://xpens.now.sh/) that allows the sharing of multiple group expenses. Additionally, Xpens would save your input, so you can get back to your calculations later.

## Usage

Add each expense by typing in the name and amount spent in appropriate fields. Once all expenses have been submitted, press 'Calculate' to generate output explaining who needs to pay more and who needs to be paid back. In case of mistakes, you can remove specific entry. Clicking 'Reset' would clean up all inputs from the application.
